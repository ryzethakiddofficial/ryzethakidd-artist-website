                <h1>Crew ft. okbreezy</h1>
                <p>“Crew” by Ryze Tha Kidd is a raw and unfiltered track that delves into themes of betrayal, heartbreak, and moving on. The song’s lyrics express intense emotions and a sense of camaraderie with the artist’s close circle, as he addresses the pain of a past relationship. With a blend of blunt language and candid reflections, Ryze Tha Kidd conveys his disdain for an ex-partner while reaffirming his loyalty to his crew. The repetitive chorus underscores his feelings of regret and anger, capturing the tumultuous aftermath of a failed romance.</p>
