                  <h1>T1M3 T0 SH1N3</h1>
                  <p>“T1M3 T0 SH1N3” by Ryze Tha Kidd is a high-energy hyperpop track that captures the frustration and intensity of being stuck in a toxic relationship. The song’s aggressive beat and raw lyrics express the anger of constantly being hurt by someone you loved. “It’s my time to shine” marks the turning point, when enough is enough and there’s a decision to break free from the cycle of fighting and heartache. The line “You can’t keep breaking my heart, you’re breaking the law” reflects the feeling of being mistreated and finally realising that it’s time to move on. The chaotic vibe of the track mirrors the emotional release of walking away from someone who has left nothing but pain behind. “T1M3 T0 SH1N3” is all about reclaiming strength and independence after being dragged down by love gone wrong.</p>
