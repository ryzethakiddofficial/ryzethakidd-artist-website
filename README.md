What's new in the Latest Update - 25th October 2024

Summary:

- Enhanced Readability and Functionality: The website's readability and functionality have been refined to ensure better performance on slower computers and mobile devices.

- Blog Page: The newly implemented blog page will feature various posts, links, photos, and videos. Stay tuned to the blog tab for clarifications on any confusions you may have, along with information on how to access my music and merchandise. In the future, I plan to add a community section where you can engage with other fans and discuss various topics. I am also working on implementing user accounts to save your purchase history and enable commenting on my posts.

- Secret Page: By typing "ryze" (without quotation marks), you will gain access to a unique page that offers previews of my upcoming releases before anyone elseâ€”free of charge.

- Countdown Page: The countdown page shows the time until my new release is available.

- Website Optimization: I have optimized the website by removing unnecessary lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a smoother experience for users on slower computers and mobile devices, particularly those with limited internet connectivity.

I have implemented numerous functions and refined the overall readability and functionality of the website. A blog page has also been added and will be updated frequently with insights into my personal life, new music, music videos, behind-the-scenes content, and much more. Additionally, I have included a secret page that can be accessed by typing "ryze" on your keyboard to activate the Easter egg. Furthermore, I have incorporated a countdown timer page that displays the time remaining until the release of my latest project. This will be updated to align with my newest releases.

I hope this website provides all the essential information about me and my artist brand.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoy the new website.

Best,
Ryan
