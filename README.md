I have optimized the storage to improve the website’s performance, as previous versions were slow. This update significantly increases loading speeds and overall smoothness.

The layout has been enhanced for better usability, with new buttons and a cleaner design for the discography pages. This reorganization makes navigation more coherent and user-friendly.

Dark mode contrast has been improved to ensure better text readability, making it easier to view content.

Animations have been refined to create a more seamless and transparent experience, ensuring they do not interfere with user interactions.

Transitions between animations and discography tabs have been made smoother, greatly enhancing the overall user experience.

The website’s viewability has been improved by adjusting color schemes, enlarging certain elements, and updating fonts to enhance readability—especially for users with visual impairments.

I have also developed a Music Client application (currently available for Windows only), which allows users to download MP3 files of my songs. While still a work in progress, it will receive regular updates. (A blog page will be added to the website soon to provide easy access to updates on the site, my music, and the Music Client.)

Finally, I’ve added a button in the footer of every page that links directly to the download page for the Music Client. Be sure to check it out (currently available for Windows only).
