                     <p class="blog-post-content">The<a href="rtk+.html">RTK+ page</a>is currently undergoing significant updates, and I’m excited to announce that I’m in the process of developing a new application that will revolutionise the way you experience my music. This innovative app will serve as a central hub, offering a convenient and organised space where you can store all of my songs in one place. Whether you’re a long-time fan or just discovering my music, you’ll have the ability to easily filter and categorise tracks, making it simpler than ever to navigate through my extensive music library. No more scrolling through endless playlists—this app is designed with your convenience in mind.<br><br>As part of the<a href="https://ryzethakiddofficial.github.io/RCMG/index.html">Ryze Collective Media Group</a>team, I’m committed to creating a platform that is not only functional but also prioritises your user experience. I understand the importance of having quick and easy access to all your favourite songs, and my goal is to make that process as seamless and intuitive as possible. The app will allow you to effortlessly organise your music collection, ensuring that every track is just a tap away. Whether you’re searching for your favourite hit or looking to discover something new, my app will make it a smooth and enjoyable process.<br><br>But that’s not all. The app will also feature a variety of exclusive content, including behind-the-scenes videos and live performances. These videos will be available for purchase, offering a unique and personal glimpse into my creative process and music journey. Additionally, you’ll be granted special access to unreleased tracks as soon as they are ready for release. You’ll be among the first to experience new music before it hits the mainstream.

As I continue to develop this app, I promise to keep you informed with all the latest updates and ensure you stay connected to every new chapter of my music journey.<br><br>Stay tuned for more information, and get ready to enjoy the full experience of RTK+ in the near future!</p>

                     <p class="blog-post-date">22nd November, 2024</p>
                     <p class="blog-post-date">Author: Ryan Duncuft</p>
                     <p class="blog-post-content">I will be adding a merchandise tab to the website within the next year. The merch will not be stored directly on the website, but it will instead link off to my merch store, where you'll be able to purchase my latest line of my merch. (I will be hoping for a major drop every year and some small drops every now and again)</p>

                     <p class="blog-post-date">23rd October, 2024</p>
                     <p class="blog-post-date">Author: Ryan Duncuft</p>
                     <p class="blog-post-content">The official blog page has been created. I will be updating this blog as frequent as needed and will be providing links to my music, Music Videos, Presave links, personal information and just general updates about me and my career. I hope to turn my music career into a full-time job and also I would really like to eventually update this whole blog page and make it look better and link off to different things. Theres a lot of stuff going on in my life, so I am taking it slow with the updates of this website. I'm going to be doing small updates to optimise, but for now the major updates will be slower. I'll keep you updated on this blog page with any new information. Thank you for all your love and support, I hope I give back what you expect. Have a great day and I'll see you soon.</p>
