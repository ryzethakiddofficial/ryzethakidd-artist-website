                        <p class="blog-post-date">22nd November, 2024</p>
                        <p class="blog-post-date">Author: Ryan Duncuft</p>
                        <p class="blog-post-content">My streaming service, RTK+, is a bit glitchy right now, I don't have an account system so I can not keep track of who has purchased something before and also if someone purchases something then loses the file down the line, they can not get that file back and will have to purchase it again.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        IF YOU DON'T MIND THIS, THEN GO AHEAD AND USE THE SERVICE. I JUST DON'T WANT BACKLASH FOR PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO REDOWNLOAD RELEASES THEY HAVE PURCHASED.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        I'm working on an app with an account system integrated so I can store what a user has purchased and open it up for redownloading in the future if a user loses the file(s). When this is finished, the <a href="rtk+.html"><strong>RTK+</strong></a> page will not be available for use anymore and any references to it will just automatically redirect you to the new RTK+ Aplication download page.

                        <p class="blog-post-content">I will be adding a merchandise tab to the website within the next year. The merch will not be stored directly on the website, but it will instead link off to my merch store, where you'll be able to purchase my latest line of my merch. (I will be hoping for a major drop every year and some small drops every now and again)

                        <p class="blog-post-date">23rd October, 2024</p>
                        <p class="blog-post-date">Author: Ryan Duncuft</p>
                        <p class="blog-post-content">The official blog page has been created. I will be updating this blog as frequent as needed and will be providing links to my music, Music Videos, Presave links, personal information and just general updates about me and my career. I hope to turn my music career into a full-time job and also I would really like to eventually update this whole blog page and make it look better and link off to different things. Theres a lot of stuff going on in my life, so I am taking it slow with the updates of this website. I'm going to be doing small updates to optimise, but for now the major updates will be slower. I'll keep you updated on this blog page with any new information. Thank you for all your love and support, I hope I give back what you expect. Have a great day and I'll see you soon.</p>
