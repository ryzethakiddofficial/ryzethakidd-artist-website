Patch Notes - Release 2.0.0

Saturday, 1st February 2025

Overview

I'm excited to introduce Release 2.0.0, a major update that completely overhauls my website with a brand-new design, improved navigation, and significant performance enhancements. This update is all about modernisation, accessibility, and making sure you have a seamless browsing experience across all devices.

New Features & Improvements

Full UI Overhaul

The entire main UI has been redesigned to be sleek, modern, and more intuitive.

Each page has been uniquely crafted to display as much information as possible while keeping everything clean and user-friendly.

Improved animations and transitions make navigating the site smoother and more visually appealing.

Mobile-Friendly Enhancements

I've added a new menu system for mobile devices, making it easier than ever to access different sections of the site.

The site is now fully responsive, so it works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Navigation has been optimised for touchscreen users, ensuring effortless browsing.

Updated Contact Page

The contact page has been completely redesigned with a sleek, modern look, making it easier and more convenient for you to submit queries or report issues.

The layout is fully optimised for mobile users, so forms and information are easy to access and interact with.

Enhanced security measures have been implemented to prevent spam and improve reliability.

Revamped Blog Page

The blog section has been updated with a cleaner, more accessible design.

Improved text formatting, spacing, and contrast make articles easier to read.

You can now navigate between articles more easily for a better reading experience.

RTK Page Update

The RTK page has been removed from the navbar, but you can still access it via a direct link from the blog page.

I'm currently working on a dedicated website and application for RTK to provide a more focused and improved experience.

This change helps declutter the main website, improving performance and reducing potential glitches.

Bug Fixes & Performance Enhancements

Fixed various graphical inconsistencies across different screen sizes and resolutions.

Addressed navigation glitches that occurred on older browsers.

Improved website loading times, so switching between pages is now much faster.

Optimised animations and effects for smoother scrolling and interaction.

Fixed an issue where some buttons were unresponsive on certain devices.

Made backend improvements to boost stability and security.

Known Issues & Future Updates

A few minor design inconsistencies remain and will be fixed in future updates.

The new RTK website and application are still in development, with an expected release later this year.

I'm actively monitoring feedback and will make additional refinements based on your reports.

Feedback & Support

I’d love to hear what you think! If you come across any issues, bugs, or have suggestions, please use the newly updated contact page to get in touch with me.

I hope you enjoy the new design, improved usability, and enhanced animations as much as I do. Thanks for being part of this journey with me!

What's new in this update, 22nd November 2024

In this update, I have cleaned up the HTML, CSS & JS. I have reworked the scripts so they all run smoother, in turn making the website run faster.
If you now go to the RTK+ tab, you will see a big banner at the top of the page warning you the page will become inoperable soon; this is because I am working on an applicationfor this streaming service and it will only be available through that app until I can find a better way to go around the web version, which only then will I add the RTK+ tab back. For now, the page will still be as normal and you can still purchase my music, but when I release the app, it will turn into a download page.

What's new in this update, 19th November 2024

In this update, I have redesigned the website to give it a more modern feeling and make it more dynamic and responsive. I have redesigned the welcome screen to give it more of a lively feel. You can also now visit the RTK+ tab to see new music and it's sorted into music and videos.

This update, hopes to ring life to the website and increase user experience.

What's new in this update, 18th November 2024

I have updated the mobile view of the website and will continue to keep creating a better looking version. I have also updated the Countdown page to reflect my new singles release date and have also added a PRESAVE button which takes you to my PRESAVE link. I will update this each time I change the countdown. I have also enhanced the viewing of the website by making the dark mode even better and making the colour scheme consistent throughout the website. I WILL BE UPDATING THE SCHEME EVEN MORE IN THE NEXT UPDATE AND I WILL BE HOPEFULLY UPDATING THE RTK+ PAGE TO REFLECT MY MUSIC BETTER AND FILTER EVERYTHING OUT BETTER, THERE WILL HOPEFULLY BE A SECTION FOR ALBUMS, EP'S, SINGLES AND COLLABS UNDER THE MUSIC TAB JUST LIKE THERE IS IN THE DISCOGRAPHY PAGE





//TUESDAY 5TH NOVEMBER 2024//
What's new in this update, 5th November 2024

I have created my own platform, called RTK+ (Ryze Tha Kidd Plus), where you can pay to download my songs in one tab and you can watch my visualisers, lyric videos, behind-the-scenes and official music videos. Behind-the-scenes and official music videos will be locked behind a paywall, but the lyric videos and visualisers will be free to watch on YouTube. Head over to the RTK+ tab to see the new songs ready to be purchased and downloaded straight to your device, NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION; JUST A ONE-TIME PAYMENT.

You can even go to the discography and look at the single you want and go to it's page and click the "PURCHASE" button to buy it.

PRICES
- Singles = £1.29
- EP's = £1.29 multiplied by however many songs are in the EP.
- Albums = £1.29 multiplied however many songs are in the album. If the album has over, or equal to, 8 songs, there will be a discount of 35% added to the final price. I will take care of all of that so don't worry about needing to get a discount code from anywhere, I'll update the price as necessary. If you are buying an album with 22 songs, the original price would be: £28.38. But with this discount, it will be £18.45.
