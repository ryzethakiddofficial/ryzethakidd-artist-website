What's new in this update, 22nd November 2024

In this update, I have cleaned up the HTML, CSS & JS. I have reworked the scripts so they all run smoother, in turn making the website run faster.
If you now go to the RTK+ tab, you will see a big banner at the top of the page warning you the page will become inoperable soon; this is because I am working on an applicationfor this streaming service and it will only be available through that app until I can find a better way to go around the web version, which only then will I add the RTK+ tab back. For now, the page will still be as normal and you can still purchase my music, but when I release the app, it will turn into a download page.

In this update, I have redesigned the website to give it a more modern feeling and make it more dynamic and responsive. I have redesigned the welcome screen to give it more of a lively feel. You can also now visit the RTK+ tab to see new music and it's sorted into music and videos.

This update, hopes to ring life to the website and increase user experience.

I have updated the mobile view of the website and will continue to keep creating a better looking version. I have also updated the Countdown page to reflect my new singles release date and have also added a PRESAVE button which takes you to my PRESAVE link. I will update this each time I change the countdown. I have also enhanced the viewing of the website by making the dark mode even better and making the colour scheme consistent throughout the website. I WILL BE UPDATING THE SCHEME EVEN MORE IN THE NEXT UPDATE AND I WILL BE HOPEFULLY UPDATING THE RTK+ PAGE TO REFLECT MY MUSIC BETTER AND FILTER EVERYTHING OUT BETTER, THERE WILL HOPEFULLY BE A SECTION FOR ALBUMS, EP'S, SINGLES AND COLLABS UNDER THE MUSIC TAB JUST LIKE THERE IS IN THE DISCOGRAPHY PAGE

What's new in this update, 5th November 2024

I have created my own platform, called RTK+ (Ryze Tha Kidd Plus), where you can pay to download my songs in one tab and you can watch my visualisers, lyric videos, behind-the-scenes and official music videos. Behind-the-scenes and official music videos will be locked behind a paywall, but the lyric videos and visualisers will be free to watch on YouTube. Head over to the RTK+ tab to see the new songs ready to be purchased and downloaded straight to your device, NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION; JUST A ONE-TIME PAYMENT.

You can even go to the discography and look at the single you want and go to it's page and click the "PURCHASE" button to buy it.

PRICES
- Singles = £1.29
- EP's = £1.29 multiplied by however many songs are in the EP.
- Albums = £1.29 multiplied however many songs are in the album. If the album has over, or equal to, 8 songs, there will be a discount of 35% added to the final price. I will take care of all of that so don't worry about needing to get a discount code from anywhere, I'll update the price as necessary. If you are buying an album with 22 songs, the original price would be: £28.38. But with this discount, it will be £18.45.
